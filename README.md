# FamilyRecipes

Welcome to **FamilyRecipes**, the place where all your cherished family recipes find a home.

## Overview

This platform is designed to help you collect, preserve, and share your family's culinary heritage. While it's still a work in progress and there are a few functionalities in development, the core features aim to facilitate a seamless experience in organizing and showcasing your family's recipes.

### Features Under Development

- **User Authentication:** Currently, anyone can edit or delete comments and recipes. As there's no login system yet, implementing proper user authentication would be a priority going forward.
- **Dummy Data** Currently, most of the data in the website is dummy data. This also makes that the images for the recipes are all the same if no custom recipes have been added.
